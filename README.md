# DragonPots - Sample Website

This is a Sass based project in which I tried to implement customizable components created by myself that I would be easily able to reuse in other projects rather than rely on Bootstrap or Materialize.

It would help me deploy websites quicker in the future and allow to think ahead when designing web components and layout.

I learnt a lot about the importance of file architecture and structure within my projects, and truly enjoyed diving deeper into Scss.
